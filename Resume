<h1>
Aidan Lindgren's Resume
</h1>
<h3>
<p>I am a fourteen year old freshman at <em>Medfield Senior Highschool</em>. Science has always been interesting to me so taking
Biology this year has allowed me to see how life around us works. I take all <strong>College 1</strong> courses and strive to take 
elective courses that will challenge me. I am very good at math and with numbers which helps me excel at engineering. For sophmore year 
I plan on taking one or two <strong>Honors</strong> classes to challenge myself even more as I get older and smarter.<br><br>I currently
 have a<strong> GPA</strong> of <strong>3.0 </strong>and due to <em>COVID-19</em> it can not be improved for the current year greatly 
since thefourth term is only worth <em>5%</em> of my grade for the current year. My focuse has not been on school but due to the rules 
of the <strong>NCAA</strong>, I have realized that in order to play basketball at the <em>collegiate</em> level you must have the 
academic credentials of the school you wish to play at, inspiring me to pursue academic success. For the first term of this year I made 
<strong>Honor Roll</strong> with grades in all of my classes being <em><strong>80%</strong> and above</em>. Besides basketball I may 
pursue coding, it's very interesting to me since there is many languages you can learn to code things like video games and resumes like 
this one.</p>

     Basketball has always been my sport of choice due to the fast pace and competetiveness of every movement that allows no dull 
     moments. Freshman year I was presented with the opportunity to try out for the freshman basketball team, so I played 17 games this 
     season only amassing 5 wins. Nobody likes a losing record, so this inspired me to work and push myself to get better 
     and stronger. In the previous fall I took part in cross country to prepare myself for the upcoming basketball season, it was one 
     of the most grueling things I had ever done thanks to the isolation of the 5Ks we had to run in the poor conditions up hills and 
     through rock beds. Determination and perserverance helped guide me through that season to condition me for the upcoming year.
