    <h1>Aidan Lindgren's Resume</h1>
<h2><p>I am a fourteen year old freshman at <em>Medfield Senior Highschool</em>. Science has always been interesting to me so taking 
Biology this year has allowed me to see how life around us works.I take all <strong>College 1</strong> courses and strive to take elective 
courses that will challenge me. I am very good at math and with number which helps me excel at engineering. For sophmore year I plan on 
taking one or two <strong>Honors</strong> classes to challenge myself even more as I get older and smarter.<br>I currently have a GPA 
of 3.0</h2>
